ColorBlindr
===========

**ColorBlindr** is a color blindness simulator for Unity3D (deuteranopia, protanopia & tritanopia with variable strength). It takes the guesswork out of designing your game for color blindness by showing you in real time what people with common color vision impairments will see. **ColorBlindr** is using the best available algorithms for simulating color vision deficiency, adapted from [Color Oracle](http://colororacle.org/).

You'll find some screenshots [here](http://imgur.com/a/uunaS#0).

Requires Unity Pro 4.3+ or Unity 5+ (Personal or Pro).

Instructions
------------

Copy the `ColorBlindr` folder into your project and add the component to your camera (drag it from the `Project` panel or use `Component -> Image Effects -> ColorBlindr`). It should be the very last image effect applied.

Remember to remove or disable it before building the final version of your game.
